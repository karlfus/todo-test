TASK 2

As a user, I want to be able to reorder my 
todos. When I choose the '▲' button, 
the todo should move up 1 position. The 
ID and all other properties of the todo 
should remain the same. If the todo is 
already at the top, nothing should happen. 
When I choose the '▼' button, the todo 
should move down 1 position. The ID and 
all other properties of the todo should 
remain the same. If the todo is already 
at the bottom, nothing should happen.
