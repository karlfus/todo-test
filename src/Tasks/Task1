TASK 1

As a user, I want to be able to mark todos as
completed and uncompleted. When the Complete 
button is clicked, the todo text on the same
row should have a strike through it and the 
item in the list should be marked 
as completed: true. Similary, when the Uncomplete 
button is clicked, the todo text on the same 
row should have no styling and the item be 
marked as completed: false.
